# Hi, I'm Ciarán 👨🏻‍💻.

I love building new products, tackling exciting problems, and mastering new skills.

I'm a senior machine learning engineer at [Workday](https://www.workday.com/), where I leverage advanced machine learning techniques to solve complex real-world problems. My recent work has a strong emphasis on the development and implementation of agentic systems.

If you'd like to chat about machine learning, agentic systems, or anything in between, feel free to [reach out](mailto:me@ciaranfinn.dev)!
